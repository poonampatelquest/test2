                             <p>An artist needs only two things in return for his work – Appreciation of the effort and fair price of his artwork. Currently, an artist needs to create his artwork and then keep on moving to various cities in order to sell the artwork. This is a very inefficient method, as it consumes up an Artist’s time, energy and resources. Moreover, it’s very tough for an artist to find a suitable place to sell their artwork and it can take a lifetime to showcase their art to the right audience. </p>
                            <p>On the other hand, many collectors and art enthusiasts want to buy artwork, but they have limited exposure to the paintings and are also afraid of the authenticity of the artwork, as fake paintings are rampant in the industry.</p>
